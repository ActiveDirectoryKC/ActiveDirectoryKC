# Hi, I’m Poolmanjim | ActiveDirectoryKC | Tyler 👋

I'm a husband, father, Christian, and Identity engineer. I love PowerShell and homelabbing so there is a good chance I'm doing one or both at any given moment. I break my lab a lot so I don't break my paying job much. I help moderate the Active Directory subreddit and host a backup of links and resources I've gathered here. Feel free to check them out! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    - Automation and tooling to improve directory services and Windows administration
    - AD Lab Automation Tools
    - Not-So-Enterprise AD Backups using Windows Server Backup and some powershell to do magic.
    - AD CS push-button build script.
    - A set of schema extension attributes. 
- 🌱 I’m learning:
    - Modern DevOps practices and cross-platform automation
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: security, automation, and infrastructure projects
- 💬 Ask me about: PowerShell, Active Directory, Windows Server, scripting, automation
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord @poolmanjim
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play games, lab, and know things.
